    <h2>Tips</h2>
    Goes well with <a href="">takoyaki</a>
    <p>Most of the ingredients can be found on a local Japanese or Asian stores.
    Feel free to substitue the welsh onion for green onions, which I personally do.</p>
    <p>Start preparing pork while waiting for the water to boil for the egg so everything is finished by the time the egg is cooked and cooled.</p>
